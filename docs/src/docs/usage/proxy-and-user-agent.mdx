-   HCaptcha
-   GeeTest

> For GeeTest and HCaptcha, proxies with IP authorization are not yet supported.
> For others, if the proxy is authorized by IP, then be sure
> to add **116.203.55.208** to the white list.

## Proxy usage ReCaptcha V2

```js
import { RecaptchaV2Task } from "node-capmonster"

const client = new RecaptchaV2Task("<api_key>")
client.setGlobalProxy({
    proxyAddress: "127.0.0.1",
    proxyPort: 61,
    proxyLogin: "username",
    proxyPassword: "password",
    proxyType: "https",
})
```

```js
import { RecaptchaV2Task } from "node-capmonster"

const client = new RecaptchaV2Task("<api_key>")
client.setGlobalUserAgent("<user_agent>")
```

> There is no difference between tasks for using
> proxy or user agent. Can be done with the same way.

## WARNING!

> **If you set the proxy or user agent, the client will
> use it until unset the values with `unsetProxy` or `unsetUserAgent` functions.**
